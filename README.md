This summer I will be making a portfolio website made out of the powerful progressive web app Svelte + Vite.
## Goals

* If an employer sees my website link in my resume, they’ll likely click on it to see what I’ve built. Seeing I’ve taken the time to build a website featuring work samples, and more will be a killer first impression.
* When an employer Googles my name, my professional portfolio will be one of the first search results that pops up.
* Because of the flexibility of an online portfolio, I'm able to show my personality by choosing design, layout and the copy I write.
